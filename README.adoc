== What is this app?

This is an example of a toy Spring Cloud Stream processing system using Kafka Streams aggregation support.

The application simply aggregates events using an object attribute.

The application demonstrates adding a micrometer support with Prometheus and NewRelic registries.

=== Running the app:

- Go to the root of the repository and do:

    docker-compose up -d

- Go to the `event-producer` folder and start sending events to kafka:

    mvn spring-boot:run

- Export `INSIGHTS_INSERT_KEY` environmental variable for NewRelic registry

- Go to the `event-aggregator` folder and start aggregating events:

    mvn spring-boot:run


Then go to the URL: http://localhost:8080/count
